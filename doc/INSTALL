**Require: expat library (need expat.h expat_external.h in /usr/local/include/)
	Installation of the expat library using ports collection (on FreeBSD) or packaging tool (on Linux).
	On FreeBSD:
		#cd /usr/ports/textproc/expat2
		#make clean install
	On Linux:(example for Ubuntu)
		#apt-get install libexpat1-dev

1. Make sure that you have the gcc compiler. 
If you use other compiler, modify the Makefile to assign CC variable to your compiler.
(Note: default FreeBSD 10 use clang instead gcc)
	CC = gcc  --> CC = your_complier

2. From source code directory, run 'make'. This will make binary file 'opencp'.

3. Still from source code directory, run 'make install' to install service script to /etc/rc.d/. 
It also copy the main configure file (opencp.conf) and 05 sample configures 
file 'opencp_xtr.xml, opencp_ms.xml, opencp_mr.xml, opencp_node.xml, opencp_rtr.xml' to /etc/. Please edit 
the configure files to suit before go to next step. The opencp_mr-sample-configure-of-ddt-root.xml file 
is an example of configuration for DDT root. The opencp_xtr-sample-configure-of-lisp-te.xml file is an examle
of configuration for rtr node.

a.  The configuration relies on a main configuration file named "opencp.conf" that allow you setup what function of 
control-plane you want and also points to specific xml configuration files of each functions.

b.  xTR configuration file (opencp_xtr.xml) includes:
	+ The <mapserver> section defines the list of MSs the xTR registers to. 
	Each MS needs a key to authenticate.
	+ The <mapresolve> section defines the list of MRs the xTR can send map-requests.
	+ One or more <eid> sections. Each section gives the information for one EID IP prefix to register.

c. Map server configuration file (opencp_ms.xml) includes:
	+ The <geid> section defines the IP prefixes the map-server allows ETR to register to. 
	The IP ranges must not be overlapped.
	+ One or more <site> sections. Each section includes the information for one site:
		+ site name,
		+ key for map-register messages (NB: the key is case sensitive and must not include spaces),
		+ EID IP prefixes the site can register.

d. DDT node and MR configuration file (opencp_mr.xml) includes:
	+ The <geid> section defines the IP prefix(es) the node is delegated. 
	The IP ranges must not be overlapped. 
	NB: if the node is a DDT root, 
	then it is here configured as being delegated for 0.0.0.0/0 (IPv4) and 0::/0 (IPv6).
	+ One or more <eid> sections. Each section contains the information for one delegated prefix. 
	Special <eid> sections with prefix equal 0.0.0.0/0 or 0::/0 is for DDT root nodes.

e. RTR configuration file (pencp_rtr.xml) includes:
	+ The <mapresolve> section defines the list of MRs the RTR can send map-requests.
	+ One or more <eid> sections. Each section includes the information for EID-prefix pass over RTR.
	
4. To start the program at first time, use '/etc/rc.d/opencp_service start' command or run manual
by ./opencp [<path_to_opencp.conf>]

5. To make program auto start when reboot, edit the /etc/rc.conf and add the flow line:
	opencp_service_enable="YES"
